This is a playground for playing around with Docker, dotnet core and some client technologies like Angular2 (later Xamarin, NativeScript etc.)

I try to meet every two weeks with some colleges to work on stuff that i like to try out.

Agenda for now:
- Docker
- dotnet core
- Angular2

Agenda for later:
- Ionic 
- Xamarin
- NativScript
- IdentityServer
